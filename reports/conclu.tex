In conclusion, during a 4-month period, we successfully build a robot application with voice command which:
\begin{itemize}
	\item can order the robot for movement
	\item has integrated with a state-of-the-art neural network image classifier: recognize 12 categories with $> 93\%$ accuracy.
	\item has integrated with a state-of-the-art neural network object detector: detect and localize objects belonging to those 12 categories
	\item can estimate distance of known size object within a range from 20 to 40 centimeters, up to $10\%$ percent error.
\end{itemize}
However, there are a lot of things we can target if we carry on the work:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the main UI can be more beautiful. In addition, a web interface is also a great idea to share my experience with users that do not have a Cozmo.
	\item implement and embed the visual-based SLAM \cite{wiki:SLAM} using Extended Kalman Filter method \cite{wiki:Kalman}. 
	\item prepare more data (manually annotate images) to get a larger dataset size in order to increase the accuracy of object detection system.
	\item build a robot ourselve which let us choose a good camera since the major part of our application is visual-based.
\end{enumerate}
