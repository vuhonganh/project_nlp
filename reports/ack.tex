Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor Prof. Jim Cunningham for the continuous support of my individual project and related research, for his patience, motivation, and immense knowledge. His guidance helped me in all the time of my project and writing of this report.
 
I would also like to thank my co-supervisor Prof. Stefan Leutenegger for his insightful advices and comments on my individual project. My sincere thanks also goes to Prof. Marc Deisenroth, Dr. Timothy Kimber, all the members in the Computing Support Group and the Microsoft Azure Grant program who gave access to the laboratory and research facilities. Without their precious support it would not be possible to conduct this project.

Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my family for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study and through the process of doing my project. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them. 

Thank you!
