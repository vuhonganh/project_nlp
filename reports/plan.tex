The list below describes the remaining tasks and its dedicated time:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Building object finding system: one of main goals of the project. This involves: \textbf{(1-2 weeks)}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Define a set of objects that robot will learn to classify previously.
		\item Prepare the dataset (images) of those objects and train a convolutional neural network for classification.
		\item Based on the classification task, solve the object detection problem. 
		\item After having detected the object, robot needs to automatically move toward and touch it.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Integrate the object finding system to our main interface. One requirement is that the interface should keep the user a smooth experience of what the robot is doing (e.g. he is searching the object, he is moving toward it). This can be done by both automatically informing and showing the robot's camera. \textbf{(1-2 weeks)}
\end{enumerate}

There are several extensions if we have time:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Implement text-to-speech system. So human beings can listen to robot's response. \textbf{(1-2 weeks)}
	\item Implement visual-based SLAM system: the robot is placed in a unknown map and it will explore the map. \textbf{(1-2 weeks)}
\end{enumerate}
